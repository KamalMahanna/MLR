# Multiple Linear Regression

1. We have some data of 50 startups. 
   Those datas are stored in '50_Startups.csv'
   We have predicted the future revenue in '50_Startups.ipynb'
   
2. 'ToyotaCorolla.csv' contains some past data,
   where based on features the price are given.
   In 'Toyota_Corolla.ipynb' we have predicted
   the price of its car based on the features.
